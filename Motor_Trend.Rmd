This is a prject assignment of the Coursera specialization named `Regression Models`.In this project I have used `mtcars` dataset.We build regression models and exploratory data analysis to find how transmissions ie `automatic` or `manual` effects `MPG`


The main objective of this research is


* Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG?

* Quantifying how different is the MPG between automatic and manual transmissions?

# Data Processing and Transformation

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
data(mtcars)
str(mtcars)


```

Converting some features into factors for processing

```{r}
mtcars[,2]<-as.factor(mtcars[,2])
mtcars[,8]<-as.factor(mtcars[,8])
mtcars[,10]<-as.factor(mtcars[,10])
mtcars[,11]<-as.factor(mtcars[,11])
mtcars[,9]<-factor(mtcars[,9],labels=c('Automatic','Manual'))

```

# Exploratory Data Analysis


* In this section we use exploratory analysis like boxplot and pairs graph.From the plot we notice that the variables <span style="color:red">cyl</span>,  <span style="color:red">disp</span>,<span style="color:red">hp</span> and <span style="color:red">wt</span> are highly correlated with each other.


* By Box Plot between <span style="color:red">mpg</span> and <span style="color:red">am</span> we found out that manual transimssion yields higher values of mpg

```{r,echo=TRUE}

boxplot(mtcars$mpg~mtcars$am, data=mtcars, notch=FALSE, 
  col=(c("gold","darkgreen")),
  main="MPG VS TRANSMISSION", xlab="Transmission",ylab="MPG")


```

# Hypothesis

At this step we take a `NULL` hypothesis that `MPG` of `Automatic` and `Manual` transmission are from the same population.We take a two sample T-test to show it.

```{r}
result<- t.test(mpg ~ am,mtcars)
result$p.value
result$estimate


```
* As <span style="color:red">p-value<0.01</span> it is significant and our hypothesis is wrong.

* Also estimates show that mean in group manual is about <span style="color:red">7</span>  more than that of group automatic which shows that they are from <span style="color:red">different poplulations.</span>


# Regression Analysis

First we build linear regression models with all the regressors

```{r}
fit<- lm(mpg ~.,mtcars)
summary(fit)


```

This model has a 


* residual error of <span style="color:red">2.833 </span> on 15 degrees of freedom


* None of variables are marked significant at significant level <span style="color:red">0.05 </span>

So we need to search a better formula to model.First we go for both <span style="color:red">forward and backward selection</span> of variables


We form a new model 


# Variable Selection

```{r,results='hide'}
new_model <- step(fit, direction="both")



```


```{r}
summary(new_model)

```

* The model find out  <span style="color:red">formula = mpg ~ wt + qsec + am </span>as the best formula for reducing residual standard error from <span style="color:red">2.833</span> to <span style="color:red">2.459</span> on <span style="color:red">28</span> degrees of freedom.

Now we form a base model with only <span style="color:red">am</span> as a predictor and <span style="color:red">mpg</span> as a dependent.

# Base Model
```{r,results='hide'}
base_model <- lm(mpg ~ am, data = mtcars)


```
```{r}
summary(base_model)

```


* It shows that on average a car has <span style="color:red">17.147 mpg</span>  with automatic transmission and if manual transmission <span style="color:red">7.245 mpg</span is increased.


* Adjusted R-squared is as low as <span style="color:red">0.3385</span> which indicates that we need to add more variables to the model.

# Comparing the Models

Now we do a Anova test to compare best model and the base model

```{r}
anova(base_model,new_model)
```
Looking at the results **p-value** obtained for the new model is highly significant.


# Residuals and Diagnostics

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(2,2))
plot(new_model)
```
# Observations


From the above plots we can make the following observations.

* The points in the **Residuals vs. Fitted plot** seem to be randomly scattered on the plot and verify the independence condition.

* The **Normal Q-Q plot** consists of the points which mostly fall on the line indicating that the residuals are normally distributed.

* The **Scale-Location plot** consists of points scattered in a constant band pattern, indicating constant variance.

* The **Residuals vs Leverage** some distinct points of interest (outliers or leverage points) in the top right of the plots.


# Conclusions

 Based on observations on our best fit model we can conclude that

* Cars with Manual transmission get more miles per gallon mpg compared to cars with Automatic transmission. **(1.8 adjusted by hp, cyl, and wt).**


* mpg will decrease by **2.5**(adjusted by hp, cyl, and am) for every **1000 lb** increase in wt. , mpg decreases negligibly with increase of hp.


* If number of cylinders, cyl increases from **4 to 6 and 8**, mpg will decrease by a factor of **3 and 2.2** respectively (adjusted by hp, wt, and am).
